This is a small funny hobby project undertook after finishing 
[this](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/micropython-and-the-internet-of-things-part-i-welcome) 
amazing introductory tutorial by Miguel Grinberg.
It uses MicroPython to code for ESP8266 microcontroller.

For now it only includes snake game with high score board.

Next plans include:
 - tetris-like game,
 - micro web server (probably based on [this series](https://defn.io/2018/02/25/web-app-from-scratch-01/)).
